#  Student Portfolio Website

This is my *first HTML + CSS project, created after completing **HTML* and learning *CSS* in the process.  
It’s a simple, clean *Student Portfolio* page that introduces who I am, what I’m learning, and the small projects I’ve built so far.

##  About the Project

I wanted to create something that represents my learning journey as a *first-year Computer Science student*.  
So, I built this portfolio to:
- Practice structuring content using *HTML5*
- Experiment with *CSS3* for colors, spacing, and layouts

##  Features

- Clean and simple layout using HTML5 structure  
-  Styled using CSS3 (colors, spacing, and borders)    
-  Sections for About, Skills, Projects, and Contact

##  Tech Stack

- *HTML5* – For page structure  
- *CSS3* – For styling and layout  
- *Git & GitHub* – For version control and deployment
