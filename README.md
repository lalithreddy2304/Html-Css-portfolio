#  HTML & CSS Portfolio

Welcome to my *HTML + CSS Portfolio Repository!*  
I created this repository as part of my web development learning journey — after completing *HTML* and starting to learn *CSS*.  
This repository showcases the projects I built while experimenting with layouts, colors, and basic styling to improve my front-end development skills.

##  About This Repository

As a *first-year Computer Science student*, I wanted to apply what I’ve learned by building small projects that reflect my growth in:
- Structuring web pages using *HTML5*
- Designing and styling them using *CSS3*
- Understanding *responsiveness, **color combinations, and **text formatting*

Each project is simple yet demonstrates different aspects of HTML and CSS.
