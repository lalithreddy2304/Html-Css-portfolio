#  HTML & CSS Portfolio

Welcome to my *HTML + CSS Portfolio Repository!*  
I created this repository as part of my web development learning journey — after completing *HTML* and starting to learn *CSS*.  
This repository showcases the projects I built while experimenting with layouts, colors, and basic styling to improve my front-end development skills.

- Structuring web pages using *HTML*
- Designing and styling them using *CSS*
