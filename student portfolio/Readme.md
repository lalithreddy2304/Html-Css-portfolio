#  Student Portfolio Website

This is my *first HTML + CSS project, created after completing **HTML* and learning *CSS* in the process.  
It’s a simple, clean *Student Portfolio* page that introduces who I am, what I’m learning, and the small projects I’ve built so far.

## About the Project

I wanted to create something that represents my learning journey as a *first-year Computer Science student*.  
So, I built this portfolio to:
- Practice structuring content using *HTML5*
- Experiment with *CSS3* for colors, spacing, and layouts
- Build a foundation for future responsive and interactive designs

The design is minimal and focuses on readability and beginner-level CSS styling.
